# HolidayRoadJavaConsoleApp
Java console app

A simple Time Off Management tool that allows users to submit time off requests and their corresponding approvals or denials. This application is developed in Java SE 8 with phpMyAdmin.

After spending the first eight years of my career working at small-to-medium sized companies, I have noticed how the process of requesting time off is incredibly slow and archaic. Even in this day and age, I have experienced processes that involved paper time off forms which required the need for written manager approvals along with a paper ledger that tracks time off taken in a given year. Obviously, there are improvements that can be made and that is exactly why I am developing my Time Off Web Applicaiton, HolidayRoad!

HolidayRoad will be an application that will allow a company to simplify the process of requesting time off, tracking time off, and assist in managerial functions such as approving/denying time off requests.
